# Transit display for [KSO](http://kso.fi)

Shows a selected amount of real-time or scheduled departures on selected bus or tram stops. A client-only application: just open `index.html` in your browser. The departures are fetched every minute by an AJAX request from [Digitransit Routing API](https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/apis/1-routing-api/).

See `scripts.js` for main functionality and modify the constants in the beginning if needed, i.e., to adjust the amount of departures to request and show.
